Project Planning

Objective: I want this services to handle user management, tracking and authentication and to be designed to be 
horizontally scalable (probably not possible because I don't have the funds). Eventually, I will create a node module for client and server side usage for other applications.
For now, this is just the backend of this service. This service is an attempt at abstracting most of what I am doing, however, I am uncertain if I will be doing it right.

Main Technologies:
 - ExpressTs
 - Mongodb
 - JWT

 Desired Structure
 - App <- routes <- controller <- service <- mongodb

 App Flow (simple);
 - Client -> authentication -> UMS
     ^                          |
     |                          v
     <------------------ verification     


User Stories (for back end):
 - Will allow the creation of new groups
 - Will store users within a group
 - Will allow users to be given roles by the owner and administrators
 - Will allow users with the administration roll to manage users within their group
 - Will show authorization attempts for specific users within a group
 - Will track which users are connected
 - Will allow for group information to be requested by authorized users with an API key
 - Will allow for individual user information to be requested by authorized users with API key

Future User Stories:
